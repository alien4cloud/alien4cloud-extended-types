    description: |
      This capability is used to define the ability for a node to manage a cluster of nodes.
      The management of other nodes is considered as a black box from the TOSCA orchestrator point of view. This capability should be associated with the definition on the node of the org.alien4cloud.management.ClusterControl interface to offer scale.
